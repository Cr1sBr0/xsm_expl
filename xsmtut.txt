Syntax : val / v <virtual_address>
Semantics : Displays the content at memory address.
eg: v 4096

in jmp instructions, the exact address is given, not the register
 JNZ R0,2074
 
 
in read sys call,push the memory address like this
MOV R2,4096           
 PUSH R2
 and not like PUSH 4096
 
 
U CANT PUSH [R1]
ONLY PUSH R1
CANT add [r1]...
only add registers
